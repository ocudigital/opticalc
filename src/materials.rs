//! Lens material constants and refractive indices.
//!
//! This module provides constants for common lens materials used in optometry
//! and ophthalmology, including their refractive indices at standard wavelengths.
//!
//! ## Refractive Indices
//!
//! All refractive indices are measured at the sodium D-line (589.3 nm) at 20Â°C,
//! which is the standard reference wavelength in optical calculations.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use opticalc::*;
//! 
//! // Convert power from CR-39 to Polycarbonate
//! let measured_power = -4.50; // measured on CR-39 lensmeter
//! let true_power = convert_power(measured_power, CR_39_INDEX, POLYCARBONATE_INDEX);
//! 
//! // Use in Rx conversion
//! let measured_rx = SpheroCyl { sphere: -2.00, cylinder: -1.00, axis_deg: 90.0 };
//! let true_rx = convert_rx(measured_rx, CR_39_INDEX, TRIVEX_INDEX);
//! ```
